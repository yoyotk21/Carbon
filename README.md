# Carbon
Functional programming language that transpiles to Racket BSL.

## Setup
Just run compiler/run.py with the file you want to compile and the output file.
For example, this converts the stoplight example to BSL racket code:
```
python compiler/run.py stoplight.cn stoplight.rkt
```

See example.cn for how to use this language. You can download Carbon or check it out at [this repl](https://replit.com/@JoelKalai1/Carbon-Language#README.md)
